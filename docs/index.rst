.. title:: PyMT

*pymt* is the *Python Modeling Toolkit*.
It is an Open Source Python package, developed by the
`Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System`_ (CSDMS),
that provides the tools needed for coupling models that expose the
`Basic Model Interface`_ (BMI).

*pymt* in three points:

* Tools for coupling models of disparate time and space scales
* A collection of Earth-surface models
* Extensible plug-in framework for adding new models


What does it look like?  Here is an example of a simple *pymt* program:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymt.models import Cem, Waves

    waves = Waves()
    cem = Cem()

    waves.initialize(*waves.setup())
    cem.initialize(*cem.setup())

    for time in range(1000):
        waves.update()
        angle = waves.get_value("wave_angle")
        cem.set_value("wave_angle", angle)
        cem.update()


*pymt* is an element of the `CSDMS Workbench`_,
an integrated system of software tools, technologies, and standards
for building and coupling models.
