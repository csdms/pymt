    "\n",
    "This lab has been designed and developed by Irina Overeem and Mark Piper, CSDMS, University of Colorado, CO \n",
    "with assistance of Kang Wang, Scott Stewart at CSDMS, University of Colorado, CO, and Elchin Jafarov, at Los Alamos National Labs, NM. \n",

    "### Classroom organization\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is the second in a series of introduction to permafrost process modeling, designed for inexperienced users. In this first lesson, we explore the Air Frost Number model and learn to use the CSDMS Python Modeling Toolkit ([PyMT](https://github.com/csdms/pymt)). We implemented a basic configuration of the Air Frost Number (as formulated by Nelson and Outcalt in 1987). This series of labs is designed for inexperienced modelers to gain some experience with running a numerical model, changing model inputs, and analyzing model output. Specifically, this first lab looks at what controls permafrost occurrence and compares the occurrence of permafrost in Russia. \n",
    "Basic theory on the Air Frost Number is presented in [Frost Number Model Lecture 1](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/File:FrostNumberModel_Lecture1.pptx).\n",

In this second lesson, we explore the Kudryavstev model and learn to use the CSDMS Python Modeling Toolkit ([PyMT](https://github.com/csdms/pymt)). We implemented the Kudryavstev model (as formulated in Anisimov et al.1997). It is dubbed the Ku-model. This series of labs is designed for inexperienced modelers to gain some experience with running a numerical model, changing model inputs, and analyzing model output. Specifically, this lab looks at what controls soil temperature and active layer thickness and compares model output with observed longterm data collected at permafrost active layer thickness monitoring sites in Fairbanks and Barrow, Alaska. \n",

    "This lab will likely take ~ 1,5 hours to complete in the classroom. This time assumes you are unfamiiar with the PyMT and need to learn setting parameters, saving runs, downloading data and looking at output (otherwise it will be much faster).\n",

    "We will use netcdf files for output, this is a standard output from all CSDMS models. If you have no experience with visualizing these files, Panoply software will be helpful. Find instructions on how to use this software.\n",
