PyMT is an Open Source Python package, developed by the
`Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System <https://csdms.colorado.edu>`_
(CSDMS), that provides the necessary tools used for the coupling of models
that expose the
`Basic Model Interface <https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io>`_
(BMI). It contains:

* Tools necessary for coupling models of disparate time and space
  scales (including grid mappers)
* Time-steppers that coordinate the sequencing of coupled models
* Exchange of data between BMI-enabled models
* Wrappers that automatically load BMI-enabled models into the PyMT
  framework
* Utilities that support open-source interfaces (UGRID, SGRID, CSDMS
  Standard Names, etc.)
* A collection of community-submitted models, written in a variety
  of programming languages, from a variety of process domains - but
  all usable from within the Python programming language
* A plug-in framework for adding additional BMI-enabled models to
  the framework

What does it look like?  Here is an example of a simple *pymt* program that
couples a *Waves* model with a *Coastline Evolution* model.

.. code-block:: python

    from pymt.models import Cem, Waves

    waves = Waves()
    cem = Cem()

    waves.initialize(*waves.setup())
    cem.initialize(*cem.setup())

    for time in range(1000):
        waves.update()
        angle = waves.get_value("wave_angle")
        cem.set_value("wave_angle", angle)
        cem.update()
